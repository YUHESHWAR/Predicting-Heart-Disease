Data Understanding:
- I hve first loaded the train data and the test data using pandas
- I have also made used the .info and .describe methods to understand the data
- I see that the data doesn't have any missing values
- I do understand that the data type of the column "Heart Disease" is string 
- The data type of column "ST depression" is float and the rest is int64
